## Files Updated

1. **translations/robust_translation_system.py**
   - Added missing translations for diet descriptions
   - Fixed "Heat styling" translation
   - Added translations for Spanish text that was incorrectly in the base file
   - Enhanced edge case handling

2. **lib/app_state.dart**
   - All English strings now translated to German
   - Spanish text replaced with German translations
   - Diet descriptions fully translated

## Verification

To verify the translation coverage:

```bash
# Run with debug mode to see all replacements
python3 translations/robust_translation_system.py lib/app_state.dart de --debug

# Check for any remaining English strings
grep -E "[A-Z][a-z]+ [a-z]+" lib/app_state.dart | grep -v "Hallo\|Antwort\|jsonDecode\|fromSerializableMap"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Trigger the translation workflow** to apply these changes to the translation branches:
   ```bash
   # Via GitHub UI or CLI
   gh workflow run build-translations.yml
   ```

2. **Verify deployment** by checking the German and Spanish sites after deployment completes

3. **Monitor for new strings** - Any new features should have their strings added to robust_translation_system.py

## Maintenance

When adding new user-facing strings:
1. Add the English string and its translations to `robust_translation_system.py`
2. Test with the debug flag to ensure proper replacement
3. Commit and push to main
4. The workflow will automatically apply translations when building language-specific versions
