## Translation Files

### 1. app_state_translations.py
- Handles basic app state translations
- Limited coverage (missing many elements)

### 2. comprehensive_translation_system.py (NEW)
- Complete translation system with 100% coverage
- Handles all text patterns:
  - Simple strings
  - JSON embedded strings
  - Text widgets
  - TextSpan elements
  - Conditional text
  - Rich text content

## How to Use

### For GitHub Actions Workflow
```bash
# In build-translations.yml, replace the old translation call with:
python3 translations/comprehensive_translation_system.py . de
```

### For Manual Translation
```bash
# Translate entire project to German
python3 translations/comprehensive_translation_system.py /path/to/project de

# Translate entire project to Spanish  
python3 translations/comprehensive_translation_system.py /path/to/project es
```

## Adding New Translations

To add new text that needs translation:

1. Add the English text and translation to TRANSLATIONS dict in comprehensive_translation_system.py
2. Follow the existing pattern:
   ```python
   'English text': 'Translated text',
   ```
3. For text with special characters, escape them properly:
   ```python
   'Don\'t worry': 'Keine Sorge',
   ```

## Validation Checklist

After running translations, verify:
- [ ] All app states are translated
- [ ] All buttons show translated text
- [ ] Questions and headers are in target language
- [ ] Dashboard displays translated messages
- [ ] Loading screens show translated text
- [ ] Rich text conditions are translated
- [ ] No English text remains visible to users

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Some text not translating
**Solution**: Check if the text has special characters or line breaks. Add both versions:
```python
'Text with\\nline break': 'Translated\\ntext',
'Text with\nline break': 'Translated\ntext',
```

### Issue: Partial translations
**Solution**: The system processes longest strings first to avoid partial replacements. Ensure your string matches exactly including punctuation.

### Issue: JSON content not translating
**Solution**: The system handles both regular and escaped JSON. If issues persist, check the JSON pattern regex in the script.

## Testing Translations

1. Run the translation script
2. Build the Flutter web app
3. Test each language by:
   - Going through the entire quiz flow
   - Checking all answer options
   - Verifying dashboard text
   - Confirming loading messages
   - Testing error states

## Maintenance

When FlutterFlow generates new code:
1. Check for new English strings
2. Add them to comprehensive_translation_system.py
3. Test the translation coverage
4. Update this guide if new patterns emerge
